<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Interesting? Yes. It&#x27;s probably a good experience to have at least once; just have an exit strategy in place going into it, even if that exit strategy is &quot;quit&quot;.<p>In my experience it wasn&#x27;t really the actual notifications and weird work hours that was the problem. The problem was that I was officially the end of the &quot;it&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s problem&quot; chain. It&#x27;s a funny thing about moral hazards and shit rolling downhill: there&#x27;s always someone at the bottom. If you&#x27;re on pager duty, you&#x27;re at the bottom.<p>So I liked feeling trusted with an important task and I liked ensuring that other people could sleep. But the pager came to represent every wrong thing with everything in the world. I stared at it in revulsion by the end of things.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">It heavily depends on the quality of management. For a system that needs 24&#x2F;7 uptime, off-hours support issues are inevitable and it&#x27;s reasonable for a company to have the people with the best ability to troubleshoot (developers) handle that stuff when it comes up.<p>HOWEVER: Is management dedicated to making sure those issues are rare? Namely:<p>1) Do they give you the time and leeway to fix technical debt that causes these things to pop up?<p>2) Are there reliable code review, continuous integration, and QA processes that ensure that fewer bugs make it to production in the first place?<p>3) Is it easy to roll-back a deployment at 2am on a Saturday?<p>4) Is there a well-maintained schedule of IT and development changes, with impact assessments, so that people don&#x27;t page you during a downtime they should&#x27;ve known about? And so that, after a failure, you can view historical data and determine the causes of a failure and effectively develop a plan for mitigating it in the future?<p>5) Can YOU page the DBAs at 2am on a Saturday when you need their help? Are they going to be rude when they call you back, or are they going to recognize that the health of the systems is their job, too?<p>6) Do devs willingly, openly own up to the bugs in their code, in front of their bosses, without fear of serious reprimand? Does the company recognize that mistakes are inevitable and that process and communication are better than blame-finding for preventing failures?<p>The answers to all of these questions (and more) will, directly or indirectly, indicate the frequency and overall stress of carrying a pager for a given company. (They&#x27;re good questions regardless of pager duty, too.)</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=9011670&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%31%30%38%36%35">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_9011736" href="vote?for=9011736&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%31%30%38%36%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_9011736"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=yanowitz">yanowitz</a> 3 minutes ago  | <a href="item?id=9011736">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I agree with these points.<p>I&#x27;m a big fan of developers being on call for their application. It puts the pain where it belongs--with those building the systems (modulo lower-level errors--such as power failures or network outages--those should go to the appropriate place).<p>However, that pain should only rest with the development team if they also have the freedom and will to spend time dealing with it. They will have spend time (either a constant tax, or more likely, with occasional sprints) to reduce operational pain. They are in the best position to reason about the tradeoffs and pragmatically reason about priorities.<p>In my experience, this produces the highest code quality and the highest team morale.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I did pager duty (on-call) for 8 years in my last job as part of professional services team. I actually enjoyed it as I thrive in stress situations. We had a good team and boss that also helped.<p>Some of the suggestions based on my experience:<p>1. Make sure there are enough team members are in on-call rotation so that you get your 1 week on-call every 6 to 8 weeks or more. If on-call is too frequent, it will be disruptive to your normal life and you and your family will resent the job.<p>2. If your on-call only requires remote phone&#x2F;access support, make sure company picks the tab for your phone and mobile internet. If, like mine, on-call requires onsite visit, company is properly compensating for mileage and auto-expense. Also get company to pay for on-call either in cash or with time-off. You can also work these out informally within your team and boss. My company paid for my cell service, home internet, and provided auto allowance.<p>3. You should have a place in your house where you can quickly go, talk, and work in the middle of the night without disturbing rest of the family.<p>4. Make sure your team and boss are okay with you coming to work late or skipping days coming to office when you are on-call and receive calls in the middle of night. My worse on-calls used to be woken up between 2:00 - 4:00 AM when I was typically in deep sleep.<p>5. Avoid scheduling anything important during the on-call week. And, let everyone know that you may have drop everything else if you receive a call.<p>6. During the on-call week relax, don&#x27;t take too much stress, don&#x27;t do too much of regular work, don&#x27;t force yourself to have a normal day-and-night, go with the flow.<p>7. Avoid going to places like movie theater where you can&#x27;t take phone call and quickly get out of.<p>8. Don&#x27;t get anxious during on-call week. I had co-workers who used to have panic attack during the on-call week.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=9011293&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%31%30%38%36%35">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_9011590" href="vote?for=9011590&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%31%30%38%36%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_9011590"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jmsduran">jmsduran</a> 27 minutes ago  | <a href="item?id=9011590">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">&gt; You always need someone standing by in case of some terrible disaster that cannot be handled automatically.<p>At large engineering companies this is typically handled via literally having someone standing by, i.e. formally on duty, rather than having off-duty employees be on pager duty. There&#x27;ll be at least a bare-bones staff on the after-hours shift, enough of a staff that reasonably foreseeable things can be handled. Of course there are some pros and cons to that from an employee perspective. On the one hand the night shift isn&#x27;t that pleasant, but on the other hand your responsibilities are at least formally limited to 40 hours&#x2F;wk; if you&#x27;re on night shift one week, you don&#x27;t come in during the day, or carry a pager during the day.<p>In that kind of setup, <i>very</i> occasionally off-duty people get called in too, if something really major goes wrong. But that should be a once a decade type of emergency; &quot;emergencies&quot; that happen once a month are, in this style of staffing, just treated as part of regular operations.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=9011705&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%31%30%38%36%35">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_9011658" href="vote?for=9011658&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%31%30%38%36%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_9011658"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=TheSwordsman">TheSwordsman</a> 15 minutes ago  | <a href="item?id=9011658">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">To echo akg, I&#x27;ve also been in experiences where the boss and team make the experience great. It&#x27;s great if you like working on small tasks that are truly dynamic.<p>Sometimes, getting paged allows me to get my head clear of your normal responsibilities. I kind of use the pages as a nice refresher for my regular work. However, personal preference.<p>To comment on one of akg&#x27;s points, the length of the schedule rotation can actually be a problem. Longer than 6-8, and you are then very detatched from the operational issues your team is having. Make sure you link up with the previous primary to get the run down on anything (and maybe even the person who was primary before her).<p>You definitely want to get more familiar with the team you will be rotating with, but:<p>1: Do not fear escalating to secondary &#x2F; asking for help when you need it. While getting paged sucks, every team I&#x27;ve been on this has been one of the biggest guidelines. We would rather someone ask for help sooner, than do something they are unsure of &#x2F; delay fixing something.<p>2 (More like an extension of akg&#x27;s #6): This is something to clear with your boss, but when I&#x27;m on call I also try to put the engineering effort in to fix alarms that are less than ideal. If I get paged at 3AM for some bullshit reason, I will spend the time the next day to make it alert when there is something actionable to be done.<p>If you are at a startup it&#x27;s probably unlikely you&#x27;ll be reimbursed for your cell phone (receiving calls). However, they should have provisions for mobile internet. Using your personal cell phone for work-related activities could have interesting legal implications. If the company is getting investigated, your personal phone could (in theory) be included as work-related things have gone through it.<p>I&#x27;ve been on pager duty for a few years now. I&#x27;ve no regrets.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I currently do pager duty (DRI) for a team within Microsoft. Like most teams that have this duty, we cycle a developer each week to have the responsibility to answer any escalations that might occur. The role of this developer is simply to mitigate the issue. Investigations into the root cause and potential preventative items are reserved for work hours.<p>The amount of escalations obviously varies from week to week. Some weeks I forget that I&#x27;m even on call (well that&#x27;s actually not true as we have to carry a Lumia 1520 - the thing is a fucking brick) while other weeks are absolutely painful (waking up every couple hours in the middle of the night). Thankfully we have enough developers on the team that I&#x27;m only on duty every 6 to 7 weeks. What also helps is that my manager has no problem with me sleeping in and showing up late after a long night of escalations.  Overall it isn&#x27;t too bad and in fact sometimes can be fun to solve head scratching issues. Honestly, the worst part of being on call is not being able to make plans that would involve you being far away from a computer. You can turn this into a somewhat positive thing though by being productive at home whether it is cleaning, working on side projects etc.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=9011593&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%31%30%38%36%35">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_9010970" href="vote?for=9010970&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%31%30%38%36%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_9010970"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jeletonskelly">jeletonskelly</a> 2 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=9010970">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Ugh, pager duty... To me it seems like it exists solely because there is a more fundamental problem in the architecture of the system. Sure, sometimes things go wrong, but if it happens so often that there needs to be an official rotation to deal with it, then it means that something is fundamentally broken. I recently passed up a good job offer because they had pager duty, and this is for a well known .com.<p>I think you should ask the developers in the other team how often they get called during their rotation. You should also ask how much of a priority it is within their work scope to eliminate the issues that are causing the processes to fail.<p>I used to work for a small company that had nightly batch processing jobs on stock data from that trading day. If any one of those processes failed, then someone had to log in and fix it or the company wouldn&#x27;t have a product for the next day. During the day we had other things to work on, things the business wanted and there was little importance given to fixing the brittle (broken) data processing. Management saw it as working software. They weren&#x27;t the ones logging in at 3am for two hours to keep the business rolling the next day. That had a big effect on me. I felt like they didn&#x27;t care about building good software, testing the software, and giving the developers peace of mind that what was in production was well tested and signed off. This is what ultimately led me to leaving that company and joining one which had solid processes: development -&gt; staging -&gt; qa -&gt; production. Because of that process we haven&#x27;t had a single outage in 3 years. I can go home at night and think about the software I&#x27;m currently building, not worrying if I&#x27;m going to get an email alert late at night because no one cares about fixing our broken software&#x2F;processes.<p>In conclusion, take heed.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=9010970&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%31%30%38%36%35">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_9011496" href="vote?for=9011496&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%31%30%38%36%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_9011496"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=justizin">justizin</a> 45 minutes ago  | <a href="item?id=9011496">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">There&#x27;s a big difference having someone who is responsible for the operation of the infrastructure being on pager duty and the developers being on pager duty. In most development shops there would be no point in having one random developer being on pager duty. What if something breaks that he&#x27;s never touched? Usually devops is first made aware of the issue, determines the cause, and, if it&#x27;s a software issue, should then reach out to the developers who are responsible for that part of the code. A pager rotation among developers means there&#x27;s something fundamentally wrong. If devops is constantly being paged because of shitty software, they should be the first to recommend that the QA -&gt; release process be evaluated because it&#x27;s clearly broken.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=9011734&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%31%30%38%36%35">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_9011534" href="vote?for=9011534&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%31%30%38%36%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_9011534"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=taco_emoji">taco_emoji</a> 39 minutes ago  | <a href="item?id=9011534">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">&gt;Does it impact overall health too much?
Depends on how often you&#x27;re paged.  If you&#x27;re waking up at 4 AM every other day then you can expect life to...not be fun.  If you&#x27;re rarely paged then it&#x27;s fine.<p>Would you say it&#x27;s an interesting experience to go through? Yes.  You will appreciate good code, frameworks and systems that seldom send pager notifications.<p>My personal preference is to rotate weekends and weekdays within a team.  That way someones entire 7 day week isn&#x27;t impacted by being on call.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=9011527&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%31%30%38%36%35">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_9011631" href="vote?for=9011631&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%31%30%38%36%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_9011631"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=skorecky">skorecky</a> 19 minutes ago  | <a href="item?id=9011631">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Pager Duty aside, being on support was really stressful for me and I&#x27;d never want to be in that position again. We were a small team so rotation was weekly and you would be on support every 4 weeks or so. I couldn&#x27;t go to the gym after work without worrying about a call coming in and ruined weekends for me.<p>But I think it depends on your personality too. It just didn&#x27;t sit well with me but it might for you. Just my 2 cents.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=9011631&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%31%30%38%36%35">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_9011627" href="vote?for=9011627&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%31%30%38%36%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_9011627"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mastermojo">mastermojo</a> 20 minutes ago  | <a href="item?id=9011627">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I&#x27;m on call for 2 weeks every couple months, one week as secondary and then the next one as primary. It basically involves carrying my laptop (and a wifi dongle) with me everywhere I go. Some times a server needs to be power cycled, but theres never anything crazy. It also completely depends on how stable your infrastructure is and how much fire-fighting everyone is doing.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Depends, I think it&#x27;s different everywhere.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">It really depends on the team and the setup. Really, it comes down to how often the system goes down and how catastrophic it is, as well as what the response is after an outage. I have been in this type of situation before, but I always had nearly full control over the system, so any failure resulted in me creating some type of safeguard against future problems. This worked well: I had very few nights where I had to do anything.<p>Really, you should ask the people on this new team, not HN.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=9010897&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%31%30%38%36%35">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_9011441" href="vote?for=9011441&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%31%30%38%36%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_9011441"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=quanticle">quanticle</a> 54 minutes ago  | <a href="item?id=9011441">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Like others are saying, the experience varies widely. One thing that I haven&#x27;t seen in the thread is a discussion of whether you actually own the code that will be causing you to get paged. One of the worst work experiences I&#x27;ve ever had is being on a platform team where we were on the hook not only for the platform problems themselves, but also for errors in application code that manifested themselves as platform issues.<p>Yes, this was a problem with insufficient logging. However, when you have a platform used internally by dozens of other teams, it&#x27;s nigh impossible to ensure that all of those teams are logging and handling errors sufficiently well to ensure that the platform team gets paged for only platform errors.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=9011441&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%31%30%38%36%35">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_9011564" href="vote?for=9011564&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%31%30%38%36%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_9011564"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=starb3ard"><font color="#3c963c">starb3ard</font></a> 33 minutes ago  | <a href="item?id=9011564">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Have an escalation plan in place. If you&#x27;re caught short while on-call, it&#x27;s good to have a 2nd or 3rd who can take over in emergencies.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Good timing, I just left a company after being on their security incident response oncall rotation for 2 years, partly due to the oncall. akg_67 has some great points (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9011293" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9011293</a>), but I&#x27;ll add a few of my own:<p>1) When you&#x27;re oncall, your time and priorities are no longer your own.<p>At your kid&#x27;s soccer game? A date night? Planning on doing any of those things? Be prepared to get pulled out at any moment to deal with something that could take hours to resolve. This was the part that really got to me. As much as I&#x27;d like to do any one of those example things, I had made a prior commitment to be available and had to honor that.<p>2) Know the response time and physical location requirements for responding to a page<p>Is this something you can just fire up your laptop and an aircard and jam on, or do you have to be able to drive to the office within an hour. Don&#x27;t forget about driving through places with less than great cell phone coverage.<p>3) It can be fun<p>There was a part of me that really liked the adrenaline rush of getting paged in on a legitimate security issue and having to run the call and pull the right people in to get the situation handled. It&#x27;s a great test of how well you know the environment and where all the pertinent information lives.<p>4) Know the team size and oncall frequency
akg_67&#x27;s estimate was spot on. Anything shorter than a month is crazy and you never quite feel like you normalize. Since it&#x27;s based on team size, know what the optimal size of the team is and that there&#x27;s funding for it? My team imploded and at the end there were only a few of us on the oncall rotation. Bear in mind that oncall duty doesn&#x27;t go away because you no longer have the staff to make it manageable.<p>5) Vacations and sick time are now more complicated<p>Who has to be oncall during Christmas&#x2F;4th of July&#x2F;etc? What used to be some loose coordination with your manager is now a give&#x2F;take discussion with your team about who covered the last holiday and who&#x27;s turn it is. It&#x27;s all completely fair and reasonable and if you have a good team dynamic you can make it work, but it&#x27;s definitely more complicated than telling Aunt Edna that of course you&#x27;ll be home for Christmas.<p>6) Get paid for it<p>Whether in flexing the hours for the time spend working a page off hours or by getting paid directly for off hours work. No reason to kill yourself for no additional compensation (and there will be those hellish pages or that automated alarm that goes off hourly starting at 3am).<p>7) Put the operational burden for supporting a thing in the hands of the people who have the ability to fix it<p>There should be a cycle of:
Get paged
Root cause
Fix
Post mortem
Deploy fix so that thing never happens again<p>If you don&#x27;t have ownership over the thing that&#x27;s paging you, you&#x27;re at risk of getting paged all night every night for something you have to go convince other people to take time out of their schedules to fix to solve a problem that they don&#x27;t feel. Not a great situation.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=9011620&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%31%30%38%36%35">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br><br>
