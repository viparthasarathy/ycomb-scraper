<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I&#x27;ve been dreaming lately of starting up a worker coop in silicon valley that focuses on consumer robotics. Is anyone interested in something like that? I&#x27;m an extremely capable hardware guy with a broad skill set and extensive robotics and manufacturing experience. I&#x27;m running my own little start up now that could help fund initial operations, and could use some people who excel at software, mechanical design, or general operations.<p>I am really troubled by the way traditional companies exploit workers, and see that as a major problem of our age. If you could show the world that a worker coop could succeed doing something highly technical like robotics, it would serve as proof that the cooperative model can work for more than just chicken farms. I&#x27;d be focused on growth like a silicon valley startup to some extent, but quality of life for everyone in the organization would be a big deal.<p>I&#x27;m also kind of curious about B-corporations, which allow a specific public benefit to share standing with profit as a legal goal. This would be more silicon-valley friendly as far as funding, since worker coops don&#x27;t have the same revenue generating opportunities for investors. Though the coop could agree to some kind of internal &quot;revenue tax&quot; to pay back investors or save money.<p>I&#x27;d love to see some wealthy people just give their money away to talented organizations that want to spread public good. What I&#x27;d love most would be to just work on open source robotics that help the world. I&#x27;ve been developing a system for 3D printed robotics that use as few non-printed parts as possible, making it easier to collaborate online with hardware designs. I don&#x27;t typically even use screws, since sourcing them can be expensive and slow - most parts just snap together or interlock.<p>An alternative plan though is for me to get rich the traditional way and then use my own money for good, so I am going to be checking out the new YC RFS for hardware whenever that comes out. I have some good ideas about improving life in the kitchen that might be workable. :)</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=9011824&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%30%39%33%37%39">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_9012016" href="vote?for=9012016&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%30%39%33%37%39"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_9012016"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=poikniok">poikniok</a> 36 minutes ago  | <a href="item?id=9012016">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I mean... if I am concerned about exploitation of workers, do you think I&#x27;d be hoping to exploit my workers? You&#x27;re basically just asking if I&#x27;m genuine or not, and the answer is yes - I actually care. I&#x27;d rather make much less than my potential pay if doing so lifted many others out of the harsh capitalist dystopia we&#x27;ve created in the US.<p>I&#x27;m actually under the impression that everyone would get paid the same, as everyone would have an equal share of the company and profits. I honestly don&#x27;t mind if the staff packing shipping boxes gets paid the same as I do designing new robots, though it is also possible to contract out nonessential parts of the operations so that the coop employees only form the core of the company. However that seems like cheating, since you&#x27;re relying on exploited workers.<p>I believe open source robotics and solar power can free us from the shackles of work we put on ourselves in the name of productivity. I have a lot of respect for Karl Marx, but I also appreciate why so many of the Marxist experiments failed in the 20th century, and I hope that 21st century tech can change things.<p>I also believe food and housing should be made available at no cost to anyone who needs it. We can easily afford that in the US, we just have a near-religious aversion to it.<p>So yes, I am genuine.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=9012130&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%30%39%33%37%39">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="120"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_9012175" href="vote?for=9012175&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%30%39%33%37%39"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_9012175"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=poikniok">poikniok</a> 7 minutes ago  | <a href="item?id=9012175">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Sorry to be so confrontational about your intentions, however I just see way to often good businesspeople (like Elon Musk) talk about how they are changing the world, while using this to underpay their workers. Now as a theoretical worker at your company, I think I couldn&#x27;t care less about what other people make, the question for me is would my pay be competitive with my other options. If however your company is based on the idea that normally I would be paid 100k and the janitor 20k, but in yours both of us will earn 60k, well I hope you can understand why I would be less than enthusiastic about this proposition.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=9012175&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%30%39%33%37%39">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_9011478" href="vote?for=9011478&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%30%39%33%37%39"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_9011478"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jandrewrogers">jandrewrogers</a> 2 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=9011478">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">One of the assertions made in the article is obviously wildly incorrect: the ratio between the highest paid and lowest paid workers in traditional corporations is not remotely 600-to-1. In the US, that would mean the top paid people in &quot;traditional corporations&quot; are earning <i>at least</i> $9M&#x2F;year.<p>Given that the average corporate CEO in the US makes a bit under $200k&#x2F;year (per the US Federal government), it would require a definition of &quot;traditional corporation&quot; that has been stretched to the point of misleading. Even for multi-billion dollar publicly traded companies, the CEO base pay is frequently &lt;$1M (this is largely public record). With very rare exception, no amount of bonuses or vested stock options will close the gap between that and a <i>minimum</i> of $9M&#x2F;year at most large corporations.<p>Some people at companies may be overcompensated but let&#x27;s be honest about what typical figures actually look like.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=9011478&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%30%39%33%37%39">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_9011592" href="vote?for=9011592&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%30%39%33%37%39"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_9011592"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dalke">dalke</a> 1 hour ago  | <a href="item?id=9011592">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">This basically sounds like the lean-startup equivalent in the non-tech space. I suspect it&#x27;s more possible than before because it&#x27;s easier for the coops to outsource the legal bits than it used to be. It is ironic and perhaps even naive to pitch this as a reaction against capitalism when it is the efficiencies of capitalism making it possible in the first place.<p>And if these people really think this is a reaction against &quot;capitalism&quot;, in its capacity as all-powerful bogeyman rather than description of how economic transactions work...<p>&quot;but to Henry Lezama, the goal is to keep growing, to bring more people into the cooperative.&quot;<p>... they&#x27;re in for a shock because as they bring in more people, in the limit this just becomes another form of business, and as more regulations kick in based on their size they won&#x27;t be able to help becoming a &quot;business&quot;, to say nothing of how &quot;flat management&quot; becomes practically impossible pretty quickly and hierarchy <i>will</i> set in. (It&#x27;s a human thing, not an ideological thing or a government thing or a &quot;capitalism&quot; thing. We instinctively, and I mean that fully literal, structure ourselves into social hierarchies.)<p>It&#x27;s fantastic that people are starting to realize this and move the gains of this sort of business structure down the economic ladder.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I assume the income inequality here is owner vs worker, rather than above average worker vs below average worker. I expect the gap between workers in most fields is much smaller than the gap between the owner&#x27;s profits and the salaries of each worker.<p>The idea is that, in a traditional company, the owner (or stockholders) puts up all the investment and risk and in return, get the lion&#x27;s share of the payoff. In the coop, there is no &#x27;owner&#x27; and any profits that aren&#x27;t reinvested in the company are divvied up by the workers. The trade-off is the difficulty in finding investment capital to get started, which is why many coops are simple businesses like cleaning services that can be started by workers pooling their resources.<p>Also, in regard to below average workers, I suppose that in many fields a coop could use productivity&#x2F;skill&#x2F;experience&#x2F;etc to scale how big a slice of the pie each worker gets. This would allow any reasonable worker to be hired, while encouraging competitive productivity. It would all depend on the coop&#x27;s rules.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=9011744&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%30%39%33%37%39">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_9011718" href="vote?for=9011718&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%30%39%33%37%39"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_9011718"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=zwieback">zwieback</a> 1 hour ago  | <a href="item?id=9011718">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">You&#x27;re absolutely right, and I think this is more an assumption <i>about</i> cooperatives rather than how cooperatives actually work. For example, Mondragon is a federation of coops some of which have hundreds of employees; they&#x27;re not going to have a debate with everybody about everything.<p>Another way to think about it is that cooperatives are the ultimate expression of a democratic workplace. Yet it&#x27;s not as if every law were discussed by everybody in a democracy.<p>In a way, that shows that we have a lot to learn about how cooperatives can work. The quote of the union representative is very relevant: Cooperatives aren&#x27;t magic dust, even though I personally believe that they are one of the key tools for dealing with the problems of capitalism. As a society, we simply have too little understanding of how cooperatives work, and until enough experiences is collected and networks exist to advise founders of cooperatives, and all those other little things that help traditional business founders are extended to cooperatives, it&#x27;s going to be difficult.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=9011829&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%30%39%33%37%39">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_9011814" href="vote?for=9011814&amp;dir=up&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%39%30%30%39%33%37%39"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_9011814"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=bryondowd">bryondowd</a> 1 hour ago  | <a href="item?id=9011814">link</a><span class="deadmark"></span></span></div><br>
